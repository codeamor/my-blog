> 문제 설명

My friend John and I are members of the "Fat to Fit Club (FFC)". John is worried because each month a list with the weights of members is published and each month he is the last on the list which means he is the heaviest.

I am the one who establishes the list so I told him: "Don't worry any more, I will modify the order of the list". It was decided to attribute a "weight" to numbers. The weight of a number will be from now on the sum of its digits.

For example 99 will have "weight" 18, 100 will have "weight" 1 so in the list 100 will come before 99.

Given a string with the weights of FFC members in normal order can you give this string ordered by "weights" of these numbers?

> 예시

```
"56 65 74 100 99 68 86 180 90" ordered by numbers weights becomes:

"100 180 90 56 65 74 68 86 99"
```

When two numbers have the same "weight", let us class them as if they were strings (alphabetical ordering) and not numbers:

180 is before 90 since, having the same "weight" (9), it comes before as a string.

All numbers in the list are positive numbers and the list can be empty.

> 주의

it may happen that the input string have leading, trailing whitespaces and more than a unique whitespace between two consecutive numbers

```js
function orderWeight(strng) {
  return (
    strng
      // 공백을 기준으로 쪼개고
      .split(' ')
      // 반환값을 객체 리터럴로 만들고 val의 값은 문자열 그대로,
      // key의 값은 문자열을 숫자로 바꿔 더한 값을 가지게 합니다.
      .map(value => {
        return {
          val: value,
          key: value.split('').reduce((acc, cur) => {
            return parseInt(acc) + parseInt(cur)
          }, 0),
        }
      })
      // console.log("map 적용", strng)

      // 자릿수 합의 값이 같은지를 조건으로,
      // 같으면 사전식 정렬을 적용하기 위해 localeCompare,
      // 다르면 오름차순 정렬을 시킵니다.
      .sort((a, b) => {
        return a.key === b.key ? a.val.localeCompare(b.val) : a.key - b.key
      })
      // console.log("정렬 적용", strng)

      // 정렬을 끝내고 원래 형태로 되돌립니다.
      .map(el => {
        return el.val
      })
      .join(' ')
  )
  // console.log("원상복귀", strng)
}
```

> what I learned

- String.prototype.localeCompare()
